# Time Management

**Youngstar:** Sorry I'm late, got stuck at work.

**Graybeard:** Happens a lot lately.

**Youngstar:** Yeah. It feels like I'm no longer in control of my time. You on
the other hand seems to have a lot of free time. How do you do it?

**Graybeard:** It's all about focus and priorities.

**Youngstar:** Do tell.

**Graybeard:** I once read an article called "[The Sad, Beautiful Fact That
We're All Going To Miss Almost Everything][miss]". It states that even if
you limit yourself to last 250 years of literature and only English. You still
won't be able to read all the good books even if you read a hundred books per
year.

**Youngstar:** I don't think even you read a hundred books per year.

**Graybeard:** I did as a teenager. But work has slowed me down a lot, not to
mention family.

**Youngstar:** Good trade-off for the family bit.

**Graybeard:** Agree, but I also enjoy my work.

**Youngstar:** OK, I get it - there's not enough time to do everything we want.

**Graybeard:** It's not just about getting it, you need to internalize it and
not regret missing things.

**Youngstar:** I'll work on it. I guess this is connected to prioritizing
things?

**Graybeard:** Exactly. Once you understand you won't get to do everything, you
prioritize and do things the matter most. Not regretting or getting tempted to
try more than you can swallow.

**Youngstar:** Sounds hard.

**Graybeard:** Yeah, I'm still learning to say "no". But this gives me enough
time to work on the things I think are important and do them well.

**Youngstar:** What if the things that are important require a lot of time?

**Graybeard:** Then you prioritize what parts are more important and do them. I
think it was Patrick Lencioni who said "If everything is important, then nothing
is."

**Youngstar:** Any tips on how to prioritize things?

**Graybeard:** There are many systems out there. I'd probably start with with
[the Eisenhower Method][emethod].

**Youngstar:** What's that?

**Graybeard:** (Draws on a napkin)

        ^
        |
        +---------------+------------+
        |               |             |
     u  | urgent        | urgent      |
     r  | not importnat | important   |
     g  |               |             |
     e  |---------------+-------------+
     n  |               |             |
     t  | not urgent    | not urgent  |
        | not important | important   |
        |               |             |
        +---------------+-------------+-->
                   important

The idea is that you want to be in the `not urgent/important` square. If
something is `urgent/important` - JFDI.

**Youngstar:** Cool. What about the other two?

**Graybeard:** The one to avoid is `urgent/not important`, it tends to suck
time.

**Youngstar:** And the last one I just don't do?

**Graybeard:** As much as you can. Successful companies tend to spend their time
at `not urgent/important` area. If you find you spend most of your time in
`urgent/important` - fix your process.

**Youngstar:** Any other tips?

**Graybeard:** There are other systems out there - [GTD][gtd], [Inbox Zero][i0]
...  Try out some, but for me it's more of a gut feeling than anything else.

**Youngstar:** Don't get me started on your gut.

**Graybeard:** Took me years to develop it, used a lot of beer in the process.

**Youngstar:** Funny! I guess I'll move "[Blink][blink]" to the top of my
reading list.

**Graybeard:** Nice prioritizing! Two common mistakes people do is not to follow
their priorities and forgetting to prioritize things outside work.

**Youngstar:** My boyfriend has been complaining I work too much.

**Graybeard:** Ouch! Nobody on their deathbed has ever said "I wish I had spent
more time at the office".

**Youngstar:** Yours?

**Graybeard:** Nope, not sure who said that.

**Youngstar:** I guess they didn't achieve much in their life either.

**Graybeard:** Oh, you'll find lazy people accomplish a lot. According to Larry
Wall the tree great virtues of a programmer are: Laziness, Impatience and Hubris.

**Youngstar:** Larry Wall Of Perl?

**Graybeard:** And `patch` and many other things.

**Youngstar:** OK. Can we move to focus now?

**Graybeard:** Sure. The basic idea is the humans are very bad at context
switching.

**Youngstar:** I can chew gum and walk at the same time.

**Graybeard:** I'm talking about things you need to concentrate on. What is
called [getting in the flow][flow].

**Youngstar:** Oh that book by the guy who I can't pronounce his name?

**Graybeard:** Yes, did you read it already?

**Youngstar:** Nope, I'll re-prioritize.

**Graybeard:** Good call. The main idea it takes about 15-20 minutes to get into
flow state where you can do things which require a lot of mental effort. Snapping
out of it is matter of seconds.

**Youngstar:** That's why I do most of the good work early in the morning when
no one is bothering me.

**Graybeard:** Which says something about your work environment.

**Youngstar:** Yeah, I just realized I need to fix this. I do like my mornings.

**Graybeard:** I knew you'd find the lazy person inside you.

**Youngstar:** I never lost it. It always surprises me how easy it is to become
a workaholic.

**Graybeard:** Yup.

**Youngstar:** OK, focus and priorities. Last words before I head home?

**Graybeard:** I'll keep you a bit more since I think it's important. Apologize
to your boyfriend for me.

**Youngstar:** Sure.

**Graybeard:** One thing is that you need time to *think*. John Cleese says you
need [a place in time and space][cleese] to be creative.

**Youngstar:** Meaning?

**Graybeard:** Allocate time for yourself, without interruptions. Use this time
to think and reflect. Don't just get carried away with day to day. I do it when
i jog.

**Youngstar:** OK. I guess I need to start jogging.

**Graybeard:** Find your own sport! Which also should be a priority for you.

**Youngstar:** What's the matter? Afraid I'll outrun you?

**Graybeard:** You already do. And you're more than welcomed to join my silent
jogging.

**Youngstar:** Will do. Anything else?

**Graybeard:** A good exercise that will force you to prioritize is leaving home
early. Say 4pm.

**Youngstar:** Yeah, right.

**Graybeard:** I'm serious. Once you go home early, you start to prioritize and
focus like nobody's business. I've seen many people doing long hours and hardly
working.

Anther good thing of short work days is it lets you charge. People get "burned"
when doing long hours.

**Youngstar:** I can feel it, seems like my productivity isn't what it used to
be.

**Graybeard:** Oh, and sleep - sleep is way underrated. People perform badly when
they're sleep deprived.

**Youngstar:** Didn't they use [sleep deprivation as kind of torture][sleep]?

**Graybeard:** They did. So get your work/life balance in order and stop
torturing yourself.

**Youngstar:** Said the person who's keeping me here.

**Graybeard:** And here I was thinking you enjoy our meetings.

**Youngstar:** I do, but I need some down time.

**Graybeard:** Go home then. I'll see you next time.

**Youngstar:** G'night.
