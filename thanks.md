# Thanks

This book is the combined effort of many people.

I'm thankful to my family who were patient with me staring at nothing or typing
frantically on the keyboard at many odd hours. I'm also thankful to many people
who contributed ideas, proofing and general help without asking anything in
return.

I'd like to say special thanks to my cousin Dorit Lewin who encouraged me to
change direction when the initial version of this book bored me and indirectly
shaped the conversational format of this book.
