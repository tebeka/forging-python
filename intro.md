**Youngstar:** Hey Graybeard, tell our readers a bit about yourself.

**Graybeard:** Why don't you introduce me and I'll introduce you?

**Youngstar:** Great idea. Let's see - You've been around the IT industry since
punch cards, you're also the best proof you can teach old dog new tricks. I have
no idea how do you find time to learn all the cool stuff you know. You're smart
and usually pretty quiet until you start talking about technology. You're
currently not doing much work but still manage to earn a lot. Oh - and you have
a quirky sense of humor.

**Graybeard:** Cute, I'm not *that* old though. About you ... You're somewhat
new to IT, finished college few years back. You're very bright and motivated and
you sold your company not long ago for *way* too much money. You also like to
learn and are one of the few people who get my humor. Oh - and you're one of the
great examples the woman can make it in high tech.

**Youngstar:** Thanks. And yeah - I'm good at pretending to like your humor.

**Graybeard:** At least you try, my wife doesn't even bother.

**Youngstar:** Oh, and we're fictional characters.

**Graybeard:** We are?

**Youngstar:** Don't pretend you don't know it. How does that make you feel?

**Graybeard:** Really? This is not that kind of book.

**Youngstar:** Can you recall how we met?

**Graybeard:** I think it was just when I was leaving that company to start
freelancing. And you just arrived, still wet behind the ears.

**Youngstar:** Yeah, I think we had about a month together before you left. Man
those were big shoes to fill!

**Graybeard:** I hope the smell wasn't that bad.

**Youngstar:** It was OK, I killed most of the fungus. Can you tell the readers
about this book.

**Graybeard:** After I left, we decided to meet about once a week in "The
Forge".

**Youngstar:** "The Forge" is a great pub just down the road.

**Graybeard:** Thanks for the close captioning. And yes - it's a great pub. We
were geeking out regularly and I was kinda mentoring you when you started that
startup doing that online thingie.

**Youngstar:** That was both great help and a lot of fun.

**Graybeard:** Yeah, and we keep meeting about once a week. But it has been less
fun since you made all that money selling your company and became a snob.

**Youngstar:** I truly hope you're joking. Also you saw some of that money, if
you recall you got some equity for all the advice you gave.

**Graybeard:** I'm joking. Money didn't spoil you, and once you're out of this
big company we might hack together on a new one.

**Youngstar:** Anything else our readers need to know?

**Graybeard:** The meetings we had were around Python. But I think most of the
things we talked about apply to other things as well.

**Youngstar:** I agree. Well, that's about the time we have for the
introduction. The attention span of the average reader nowadays is pretty low.
Hope you'll have as much fun reading the book as we had in those drinking
meeting.

**Graybeard:** Cheers!
